# tophertime-studios__tawabb_alexl175_jacobl153_jonathanm764

This is a forked repo of a geoguesser clone I created with my friends.
NOTE: API key doesn't work anymore because we broke and can't afford Google Maps API. However, you can still get a feel for what the website was supposed to feel like, and the frontend styling and back end databases still work as intended.
Let me know if there is anything else you want to see from a project in order for me to join FSAB.

**Database Lead:** Jonathan Metzler

# Project Description:

Our project will be focused on creating a replica of GeoGuessr by using GoogleMaps StreetView panoramas. During each round the server picks a random StreetView coordinate and shows the panorama next to an interactive world map (depending on the region the user has selected). The player drops a marker on where they think the street is located and submits. The game then reveals the location, draws a distance line, and awards points based on the distance between the true location and the user's location. Our game has multiple regions and a timed mode. 

**Prerequisites**

Ensure that **Git** and **Python** are installed on your machine. It is recommended that you use a virtual machine when running this project to avoid any possible conflicts. For help, refer to the following documentation:
   1. Installing Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git 
   2. Installing Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

   3. (Optional) Setting up Git with SSH (Ms. Novillo's APCSA Guide): https://novillo-cs.github.io/apcsa/tools/ 
         

**Cloning the Project**
1. Create Python virtual environment:

```
$ python3 -m PATH/TO/venv_name
```

2. Activate virtual environment 

   - Linux: `$ . PATH/TO/venv_name/bin/activate`
   - Windows (PowerShell): `> . .\PATH\TO\venv_name\Scripts\activate`
   - Windows (Command Prompt): `>PATH\TO\venv_name\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS: `$ source PATH/TO/venv_name/bin/activate`

   *Notes*

   - If successful, command line will display name of virtual environment: `(venv_name) $ `

   - To close a virtual environment, simply type `$ deactivate` in the terminal
